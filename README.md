# Chord Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on examining chord patterns in songs from the McGill Billboard Dataset. The project explores the differences in chord tendencies between guitar-driven and piano-driven songs using various data wrangling and visualization techniques in R.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Analyze the most common chords and chord bigrams (two-chord sequences) in guitar-driven and piano-driven songs.
2. Visualize the frequency of these chords and bigrams to identify distinct patterns.
3. Validate the hypothesis that guitar-driven and piano-driven songs have different chord tendencies.

## Files in the Repository

- `notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis, including data wrangling, visualization, and conclusions.
- `datasets/`: A directory containing the dataset files used in the analysis.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chord-Analysis-Visualization.git
   cd Chord-Analysis-Visualization
